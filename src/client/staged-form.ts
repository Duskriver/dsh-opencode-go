/**
 * The staged form behind the OpenCode Go settings page.
 *
 * The page stages what the user types and writes it only when they save. Each
 * settings write is a durable, revision-fenced document mutation, so a control
 * that committed as it settled turned one edit into a write the user never
 * asked for and could not preview; staged text makes what is on screen exactly
 * what a save would store.
 *
 * A field shows its effective value — the user layer over the composition
 * layer over the schema default — and whether the user layer carries it. That
 * presence, not a value comparison, is what marks a field overridden: an
 * override equal to the composition default is still an override.
 *
 * Copied from the plugin-configuration card form (`ui-settings-plugins`): the
 * client bundle purity gate forbids importing it across packages, and the two
 * forms evolve independently anyway.
